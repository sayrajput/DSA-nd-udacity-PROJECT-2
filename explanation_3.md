# Huffman Coding  
## Explanation  
  

### Data Structures  
Tree  
Heap  
Dictionary  
List  
  

### Time Complexity  
Overall time complexity is **O(nlogn)**  
How ?  
Dictionary is used for mapping so it takes O(1) to get values from map  
For adding values to dictionary it will take O(n) time  
**heappush()** method takes O(logn) time, for n elements it will take **O(nlogn)** time  
  
### Space Complexity  
It requires **O(n)** space
